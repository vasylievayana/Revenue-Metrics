# Revenue-Metrics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive dashboard to analyze key revenue metrics. The dashboard is a powerful tool for product managers, enabling them to track revenue trends, analyze factors influencing revenue changes, identify growth opportunities, and pinpoint areas of concern. The ultimate goal is to provide clear and actionable insights into revenue performance, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Key Metrics Included
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** The total revenue generated from recurring sources within a calendar month.
- **Paid Users:** The total number of paying users within the specified period.
- **Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU):** A measure of revenue per paying user, calculated as Revenue / Paid Users.
- **New Paid Users:** The number of users who began paying during the specified period.
- **New MRR:** MRR generated by users who became paying customers during the specified month.
- **Churned Users:** The number of users who stopped paying during the specified period.
- **Churn Rate:** The ratio of churned users in a target period to the paid users in the previous period.
- **Churned Revenue:** The total revenue lost due to user churn.
- **Revenue Churn Rate:** The ratio of lost revenue due to churn to the total MRR of the previous month.
- **Expansion MRR:** The amount by which MRR increased from one month to another.
- **Contraction MRR:** The amount by which MRR has decreased from one month to the next.
- **Customer Lifetime (LT):** The average duration from a user's first payment to the time they churn.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** The total revenue a user is expected to generate during their entire lifetime with the product.

## Main Stages

### 1. Data Extraction and SQL Query Development
- I began by writing an SQL query to create a summary table of monthly revenue for each user. This involved aggregating revenue data from the `games_payments` table, grouping by user and game, and calculating the total revenue for each month.
- Next, I computed essential revenue metrics, such as new Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), churned revenue, revenue expansion, contraction, and users returning from churn.

### 2. Data Transformation and Metric Calculation in Tableau
- After the initial data extraction, I further processed the data to calculate specific metrics needed for the analysis. These included metrics such as ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User), churned users, churn rate, revenue churn rate, customer lifetime, lifetime value, new paid users, and total paid users.

### 3. Data Visualization and Dashboard Development in Tableau
- With the metrics calculated, I designed a dashboard in Tableau. The dashboard visualizes key revenue and user metrics, providing insights into Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and paid user trends over time.
- To enhance the usability of the dashboard, I implemented filters that allow users to explore data by specific attributes such as language, age group, and payment month. This interactivity makes the dashboard a powerful tool for analyzing user behavior and revenue trends across different segments.Link to visualization in [Tableu.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yana.vasylievaya/viz/Revenue_17243371244900/Dashboard1)
